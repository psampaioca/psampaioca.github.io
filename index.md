## Hello! Welcome to my Website!

My name is Pedro Sampaio, I'm a student in Conestoga College, Waterloo - ON, Canada. Studying Computer Programming.
I am a civil engineer with experience in construction management, finance and entrepreneurship. My past works involved mainly controlling projects budget and operations management. I am gaining experience in Web Dev and discovering a new passion.

The main goal here in this website is to provide some projects done during my program in Conestoga. They are going to give some perspective of growing.

### Projects

Obs.: All these projects are very introdutory and the main goal is to present some information of evolution. All is made up.
